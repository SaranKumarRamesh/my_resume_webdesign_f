Front-end Design for My Website

This repository contains the front-end design for my personal website. The website is built using Node.js and Angular, with an MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern.


Pages

The website consists of the following pages:
•	About
•	Home
•	Skill-prj
•	Exp-edu
•	Contact-me


Features

•	Utilizes Angular for dynamic front-end development.
•	Implements an MVC design pattern for organizing code and logic.
•	Includes normalization files for consistent styling across pages.
•	Integrates Bootstrap for UI enhancements.
•	Uses MySQL database for data management. Backend connection to the database will be implemented separately.


Getting Started

1.	Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.	Install Node.js if not already installed.
3.	Navigate to the project directory and run npm install to install dependencies.
6.  Run node server.js in the command prompt or terminal first. This starts the server  that listens on port 3000, and keep it running.
5.	Run ng serve to start the development server.
6.	Access the website at http://localhost:4200.


Future Work
